        <p class="about-summary">Hello, I'm Isaac Alter, and I am a web developer with most of my experience being in Back-End development currently based in the Colorado Springs, Colorado area. I've worked in a variety of lnagugages and tech stacks, ranging from Ruby alongside the Ruby on Rails framework, Python, C#, C++, and Java. I am also familiar with PostgreSQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I am a big fan of stories and games, especially worlds and characters that you can immerse yourself in. I am driven to do the best I can and to always improve, whether by learning new skills or honing my current abilities.</p>
